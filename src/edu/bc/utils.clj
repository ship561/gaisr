   must be equal to the number of collections being folded with

   here uses the reducer lib fold at base, and thus uses work stealing
   deque f/j to mostly relieve the partition problem.  In signatures
   with N given, N provides the packet granularity, or if (< N 1),
   granularity is determined automatically (see below) as in the
   base (non N case) signature.

   While xfold is based on r/fold, it abstracts over the combiner,
   reducer, work packet granularity, and transforming multiple
   collections for processing by f by chunking the _transpose_ of the
   collection of collections.

   As indicated above, xfold's fold combiner is monoidal on vectors:
   it constructs a new vector from an l and r vector, and has identity
   [] (empty vector).  In line with this, xfold's reducer builds up
   new vectors from elements by conjing (f a1, ... an) onto a prior
   result or the combiner identity, [], as initial result.

   Packet granularity is determined automatically (base case or N=0)
   or supplied with N > 1 in signatures with N.  Automatic
   determination tries to balance significant work chunks (keep thread
   overhead low), with chunks that are small enough to have multiple
   instances per worker queue (supporting stealing by those workers
   that finish ahead of others).
